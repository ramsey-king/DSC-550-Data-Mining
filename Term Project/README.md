# Summary

This project consisted of a text classification project of sermons given by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  The corpora of sermons can be found at speeches.byu.edu.  The ability to search for sermons by topic is of importance for multiple reasons.  One reason is we have seen the explosion of demand for being able to search for items that we are interested in through the advances of the Internet and search engines such as Google.com.  More specific to an audience of those looking for sermons by topic, on occasion, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints are asked to give speeches of their own.  Having the ability to search for other texts based on the topic that we will be speaking on is beneficial for our preparation.
